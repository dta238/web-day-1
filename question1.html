<h2>verse</h2>

<p>Hear the drums echoing tonight</p>
<img src="./images/drums.jpg" alt="drums" width="200">
<p>But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation</p>
<p>do do do do do do doo</p>
<p>She's comin' in, 12:30 flight</p>
<p>Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation</p>
<p>do do do dodo do do</p>
<p>I stopped an old man along the way</p>
<p>Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies</p>
<p>do do do dodo do doo</p>
<p>He turned to me as if to say</p>
<p>"Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"</p>

<h2>chorus</h2>

<ul>
<li>It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you</li>
<li>There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do</li>
<li>I bless the rains down in Africa</li>
<img src="./images/rains.webp" alt="africa" width="200">
<li>Gonna take some time to do the things we never had, ooh-hoo</li>
</ul>


<h2>verse</h2>

<p>The wild dogs cry out in the night</p>
<p>As they grow restless longing for some solitary company</p>
<p>I know that I must do what's right</p>
<p>Sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti</p>
<img src="./images/spaghetti.jpg" alt="africa" width="200">
<p>I seek to cure what's deep inside</p>
<p>Frightened of this thing that I've become</p>

<h2>bridge</h2>

Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you <br>

<h2>chorus</h2>

<li>Gonna take some time to do the things we never had, ooh-hoo</li>
</ul>

<h2>outro</h2>

I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains) <br>
I bless the rains down in Africa <br>
I bless the rains down in Africa (ooh, I'm gonna take the time) <br>
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had, ooh-hoo <br>
